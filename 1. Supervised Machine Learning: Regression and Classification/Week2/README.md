# Week 2
## Objective
- Build and train a regression model that takes multiple features as input (multiple linear regression).
- Implement the cost function and gradient descent for multiple linear regression.
- Implement methods for improving machine learning models by choosing the learning rate, plotting the learning curve, performing feature engineering, and applying polynomial regression.
