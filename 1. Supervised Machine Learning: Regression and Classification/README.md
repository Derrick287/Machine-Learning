# 1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

## Week 1
### Objective
- Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and regression and classification tasks.
- Build a linear regression model.
- Implement the purpose of a cost function.
- Implement how gradient descent is used to train a Machine Learning model.

## Week 2
### Objective
- Build and train a regression model that takes multiple features as input (multiple linear regression).
- Implement the cost function and gradient descent for multiple linear regression.
- Implement methods for improving machine learning models by choosing the learning rate, plotting the learning curve, performing feature engineering, and applying polynomial regression.
